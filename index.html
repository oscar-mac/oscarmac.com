                        Scrolling up and down looking for information. In the exhibition page: the user would rather have a visual preview of the exhibition before reading a lengthy description. 
                        The flow of information should reflect this order. Not unlike a piece of artwork in a gallery, the viewer is likely to look at the work before reading its description.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
                    <p>To easily access exhibition information. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h4>
                    <p>
                        First-time visitors are most likely visiting the website to look for an exhibition that interests them. Therefore, it is important to make it easy for them to find relevant information 
                        without having to read through long exhibition descriptions. The current landing page does not provide any descriptions for the exhibitions, which means that users must click into 
                        each individual page to learn more. Providing brief descriptions of each exhibition on the landing page would allow users to quickly identify which exhibitions they're interested in visiting.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The majority of users first encounter of the website will be quickly accessing information on current exhibitions. These users are likely to return to the website for new information at a 
                        later time e.g: make an account, look at other events.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The carousel of select exhibitions and the first section of the landing page both indicate that the primary user goal is to access information about exhibitions. There is no clear 
                        path for users to follow once they have obtained this information. Provide clear and concise user journeys that guide the user towards the next steps they should take.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>Segregating menus in the navigation bar for first-time and returning users could make this user journey more concise from the beginning.</p>

            <h2>Week 3 Questions</h2>
            <hr style="border-top-color:black;border-top-width:2.5px;"/>

            <ul>
                <li>
                   <h4>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
                   <p>
                    The use of whitespace around select exhibitions on the landing page emulates the atmosphere of the gallery in which the works are the visitor's primary focus.
                    By isolating the subject in this way, the viewers full focus is captured, diverting attention from any other distractions.
                   </p>

                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h4>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The use of whitespace draws heightened attention to the subject (exhibitions on the landing page), naturally directing the user to engage with it.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Whitespace is used to draw attention to the subject and create a sense of engagement, effectively separating it from the surrounding content. 
                        This whitespace also allows the eyes to rest while the brain processes information, preventing the user from feeling overwhelmed.
                    </p>
 
                 </li>

                 <li>
                    <h4>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The lack of a clear path for users to follow on the website, leaves the first-time user feeling disoriented.
                        Without proper guidance, navigating the site can become challenging and overwhelming, causing 
                        frustration for users.

                        A first-time user is likely looking for basic information but must mentally sort through the surplus of content presented on the website.
                    </p>

                </li>
                
                 <li>
                    <h4>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Subtle feedback on hover satifies the user, indicating that an element can be clicked or interacted with in some way. This feedback makes the experience feel more dynamic and engaging. 
                        This feedback is consistent across the website, creating a better user experience by making it easier for the user to navigate and interact with the website.      
                    </p>
 
                 </li>

            </ol>
